Fading Line Banner_Skinalyze

Team: C241-PS385

Project for: Capstone Project Bangkit Academy 2024 H1

Objective
📱 Develop a mobile application (Android) for personalized skincare recommendations.

🧠 Implement a machine-learning model for Skin Problem Classification. This model will analyze user-uploaded facial photos and identify specific skin concerns (e.g., dark spots, acne, pores).

💡 Design a recommendation system that goes beyond skin type identification. This system will offer personalized skincare product packages tailored to individual skin concerns.

😌 Simplify the skincare product selection process for users. This will be achieved by providing a user-centric application with clear and actionable recommendations.

📚 Promote informed decision-making regarding skincare products. This will be done by leveraging machine learning and personalized analysis.

♻️ Reduce product waste in the skincare industry. This will be achieved by recommending effective product packages that directly address users' specific needs.
