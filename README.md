## Cloud Computing Task
In skinalyze the cloud computing team is task to create API's, database, and also deploy both database and API's so it can be used by the mobile application to then be used to store and fetch the data

## API's
### Register
In register.js API will get 5 fields from body :
* name
* email
* password
* gender
* age
if one of the fields is null the API will return "Terdapat Field yang kosong!" and if the email is already on the database the API will return "Email sudah terdaftar."
<br>
if all the fields are filled and the email is not on the database the API will post the field into the database with encrypted password and encoded gender ( male = 1, female = 0). API will also return "User berhasil dibuat."
